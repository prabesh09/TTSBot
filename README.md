# Telegram TTSBot

A simple telegram bot that converts text to natural human speech using edge tts.
## Installation

### 1. Clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prabesh09/TTSBot.git
```

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Creating a telegram bot

Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and create a new telegram bot.
### 4. Generating audio

Once a Telegram bot has been created, an API token will be generated. This token must then be inserted into the project. When you send a message to the Telegram bot you created, it will process your message and create an audio file as a response. So, basically, you type something to the bot and it will send you back an audio file. (The bot only works when the program is running.)
